# My-Plants
An app where user can track their plants and their watering schedule. Home page lists all of the user's plants. For each plant, number of days left until it needs to be watered is shown, as well as the plant's name, and a 'Water' button. Home page also has a 'Add plant' button, that takes you to a new page where user can create a new plant. When creating a new plant, user should give it a name and specify how often it needs to be watered (in the number of days). Plants are saved in the database. User can access only their own plants.
